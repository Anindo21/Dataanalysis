# Ames Housing Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing the **Ames Housing Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains detailed information about various houses in Ames, Iowa. The analysis focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and exploring the data to extract useful insights.

## Dataset

The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset?resource=download). Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory of this repository.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and sync with GitHub.

### 1. Install Anaconda

First, install **Anaconda** for managing Python environments and dependencies.

- Download and install Anaconda from the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section).
- Verify the installation:

  ```bash
  conda --version
  ```

### 2. Create a Conda Environment

Next, create a dedicated Conda environment for this project to manage dependencies.

```bash
conda create -n housing-analysis python=3.9
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate housing-analysis
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

After activating the environment, install the necessary Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `jupyter`.

```bash
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

If you need any additional libraries, you can install them as needed.

### 4. Set Up Git and GitHub

#### Install Git

- Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Verify Git installation by running:

  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

#### Set Up a GitHub Repository

- Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
  ```

- Navigate to the cloned directory:

  ```bash
  cd your-repo-name
  ```

#### Initialize the Project

- Initialize Git in your project directory (if not already done):

  ```bash
  git init
  ```

### 5. Download the Ames Housing Dataset

- Download the **Ames Housing Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset?resource=download).
- Place the dataset in a folder called `data/` within your repository.

### 6. Add Files to Git and Sync with GitHub

#### Add New Files

- After creating or adding files (such as data or Jupyter notebooks), you need to stage and commit the changes:

  ```bash
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Add new data and initial project files"
  ```

## Usage

1. After setting up the environment, run Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Load and explore the **Ames Housing Dataset** in your notebook or Python script.

3. Perform data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for further analysis or machine learning models.
